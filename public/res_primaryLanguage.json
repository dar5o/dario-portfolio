      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Dario Vitorte. Iâ€™m a software engineer that is passionate about video games and coding. I've had a keen interest in coding since I was in middle school and I am mastering Javascript at CodeFellows to further my goal to work in the gaming industry. I have prepared myself for this career by studying computer science in high school and doing extracurricular programs in Java. Prior to this boot camp, I took some community college courses, was a software and hardware betting terminal technician at Golden Gate Fields, and was a semi-pro Valorant gamer. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
